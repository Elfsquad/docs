The Elfsquad Data API enables you to query and manipulate plain data through an API call. No business logic or events will be triggered when making changes through this API.

This API implements the OData specification which can be used to specify filters etc.

Example use-cases:

Populate a business intelligence dashboard
Edit a quotation status without triggering any logic/events
Synchonise data with third party applications such as ERP and CAD
The Elfsquad Excel plugin uses this API to query and change data
