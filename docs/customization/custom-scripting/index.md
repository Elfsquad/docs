Custom scripting can be used to add your own custom logic to Elfsquad.


## What are custom scripts
Custom scripts are snippets of JavaScript code that are executed in the user's browser when a pre-defined event is fired. 
For example, it is possible to define a script on the quotation edit page, that takes the current quotation and generates a Excel sheet for it.

## Getting started
To start using the custom scripting functionality you can follow the [getting started guide](getting-started).

## Examples
A set of example scripts can be found [here](examples).
