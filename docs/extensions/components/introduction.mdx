You can extend the functionality of existing pages in Elfsquad, by adding
custom actions. These actions will appear as action buttons in the page toolbar.

## `elfsquadrc.yml` structure
Each action is defined in the `page_extensions` section of the `elfsquadrc` file. 
The entrypoint of the action refers to a file in the build (`dist`) directory of 
the extension. This should either be a `.js` file for an action or a `.html` file 
for a dialog.

Depending on the type of the executable, the entrypoint will either be executed in 
the background, or shown in a dialog.

### Example
```yaml
page_extensions:
  <page_name>:
    actions:
    - position: [left|right]
      color: [primary|accent]

      names:
        <language_iso>: <button_name>

      executable: 
        type: [action|dialog]
        entrypoint: <file_path>
```
