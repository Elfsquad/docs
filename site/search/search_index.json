To request an access token, make a HTTP request to the API with the following parameters: URI: POST https://api.elfskot.cloud/api/2/auth/elfskotconnectlogin Content-type: application/json Body: { \"clientId\": \"2313449e-b71a-4abd-b3df-934eec91712e\", \"secret\": \"cbg7cult\" } When the request is submitted, and all the parameters are correct, the API will return an access token: { \"accessToken\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIwMDAwMDAwMC0wMDAwLTAwMDAtMDAwMC0wMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAiLCJqdGkiOiI3Y2JhNTY4MC03MTA5LTQ4Y2QtOWIzMi0zZTBjMzVlODA2ODciLCJpYXQiOjE1MzkzMzIxMDYsInRlbmFudGlkIjoiYTRlY2U3OWYtZjZmMC00YzgwLTljYmEtMDhkNGFkMGQ4NTRmIiwib3JnYW5pemF0aW9uaWQiOiIiLCJpc0VsZnNrb3RDb25uZWN0IjoiVHJ1ZSIsIm5iZiI6MTUzOTMzMjEwNiwiZXhwIjoxNTM5MzMzOTA2LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwaS5lbGZza290LmNsb3VkLyIsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBpLmVsZnNrb3QuY2xvdWQvIn0.lqVHiSG7wZkmFtuuRY5n3S_sGYazHYdD8HMokRL7Lf0\", \"expiresIn\": 1800000 } An example of how this is done in Postman, is shown below: Error responses If the API gives a 415 Unsupported Media Type error, make sure that the content type of the request is set to application/json .

The examples will show the following: How to retrieve a list of features. How to create a new feature. How to retrieve a single feature. How to update a feature. How to delete a feature. There is also a complete project available for download . This project contains example code that will show how to accomplish the above described tasks. If you do not know how to connect to the API, please check out the getting started with the API first. Retrieving an access token The following C# function will retrieve an access token from the API. // Retrieves an access token from the API. This requires an integration application in // the Elfskot Management System. See http://docs.elfskot.com for more information. static string RequestAccessToken(string applicationId, string secret) { using(var client = new HttpClient()) { var body = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(new { clientId = applicationId, secret = secret }); var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Post, \"https://api.elfskot.cloud/api/2/auth/elfskotconnectlogin\"); request.Content = new StringContent(body, Encoding.UTF8, \"application/json\"); var response = client.SendAsync(request).Result; if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode) { Console.WriteLine(\"Successfully retrieved an access token.\"); return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<dynamic>(response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result).accessToken; } else { throw new HttpRequestException($\"Failed to request access token, server responded with status code: {response.StatusCode}\"); } } } The access token should be included in every request. Retrieving a list of features To request all the features, we will call the following endpoint: https://api.elfskot.cloud/api/2/features?include=Texts&skip=0&take=5 . // Retrieve a list of all features. static void RetrieveAllFeatures(string token) { using(var client = new HttpClient()) { // Appending ?include=Texts will have the API to include the texts. You can also use skip/take to filter. // All the filter parameters are optional. See http://docs.elfskot.com for more information about filtering options. var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, \"https://api.elfskot.cloud/api/2/features?include=Texts&skip=0&take=5\"); request.Headers.Add(\"Authorization\", $\"bearer {token}\"); PrintHTTPRequest(request); var response = client.SendAsync(request).Result; if(response.IsSuccessStatusCode) { var features = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<dynamic>(response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result); Console.WriteLine($\"Retrieved {features.Count} features.\"); Console.WriteLine(features.First); // We can also loop through all the retrieved features. //foreach(var feature in features) //{ // Console.WriteLine(feature.name); //} } else { throw new HttpRequestException($\"Failed HTTP request, server responded with status code: {response.StatusCode}\"); } } } Creating a new feature To create a new feature, we first need to create a JSON object. This example creates an anonymous object which is converted to a JSON object. It is possible to include multiple layers of objects, i.e. the feature and the texts can be created in a single request. All the languages are already available in the API, as defined in ISO 639-1. Simply fill the languageIso with the two letter ISO. The API will return the created model at the end of the request. This contains the assigned ID which can be used later. // Creates a new feature in your Elfskot Management System, and // returns the ID of the newly created feature. static object CreateFeature(string token) { // This object is serialized to a JSON string, see the raw HTTP content // to see what the request looks like. var feature = new { name = \"Example feature\", articleCode = \"CODE-123\", salesPrice = 1000m, packingUnit = 1, texts = new List<object>() { new { languageIso = \"en\", // 2-letter ISO code, all the languages are already there. type = 0, // Description value = \"Example feature description\" }, new { languageIso = \"en\", type = 1, // Extended description value = \"Example feature extended description\" }, new { languageIso = \"en\", type = 2, // More info value = \"Example feature more info\" } }, cardImageUrl = \"https://www.elfskot.com/wp-content/themes/elfskot/dist/svg/logo-elfskot.svg\" }; using (var client = new HttpClient()) { var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Post, \"https://api.elfskot.cloud/api/2/features\"); request.Headers.Add(\"Authorization\", $\"bearer {token}\"); request.Content = new StringContent(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(feature), Encoding.UTF8, \"application/json\"); var response = client.SendAsync(request).Result; if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode) { // The entire feature is stored in 'result'. var result = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<dynamic>(response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result); Console.WriteLine($\"Successfully created new feature with id: {result.id}\"); return result; } else { throw new HttpRequestException($\"Failed HTTP request, server responded with status code: {response.StatusCode}\"); } } } Retrieve a single feature To retrieve a single feature, call the endpoint https://api.elfskot.cloud/api/2/features/{id}?include=Texts with the ID of the feature. If you want additional properties, such as texts, they need to be included seperately. If a property is null , you probably need to include this in the request. // Retrieve a single feature by ID. static object RetrieveFeatureById(string token, string id) { using (var client = new HttpClient()) { // Appending ?include=Texts will have the API to include the texts. var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, $\"https://api.elfskot.cloud/api/2/features/{id}?include=Texts\"); request.Headers.Add(\"Authorization\", $\"bearer {token}\"); PrintHTTPRequest(request); var response = client.SendAsync(request).Result; if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode) { var content = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result; var feature = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<dynamic>(content); Console.WriteLine(feature); return feature; } else { throw new HttpRequestException($\"Failed HTTP request, server responded with status code: {response.StatusCode}\"); } } } Update an existing feature Updating an existing feature is almost identical to creating a new feature.

This ensures that the API is only processing a single record, which improves the speed. For example: db.all('features').sort('name').take(1).first() . Usage demonstration Getting started First instantiate a new ElfskotApi object with the appId and secret which are found in the integrations tab in your EMS. db = ElfskotApi('appId', 'secret') While initializing the object, an authorization token is requested from the API. When the object is initialized, it is now possible to query our REST API. As an example, we will request a sorted list (by name) of features. Also, the texts of the feature should be included in the query. Finally, we take the first feature that is found and print it. db.all('features').sort('name').include('texts').take(1).first() {'articleCode': None, 'cardImageUrl': None, 'category': None, 'categoryId': None, 'createdDate': '2018-03-30T09:52:47.7797469+00:00', 'creatorId': '7c10626d-6d57-403c-ec51-08d56407f341', 'customField1': None, 'customField2': None, 'customField3': None, 'customField4': None, 'customField5': None, 'hiddenThreeDModelItems': [], 'id': 'be855af0-3cf2-47c0-bac8-08d595a67251', 'marginPct': 0.0, 'maxValue': 0.0, 'minValue': 0.0, 'name': None, 'organizationId': None, 'organizationName': None, 'organizationSellsFeature': None, 'packingUnit': 0.0, 'properties': None, 'reference': None, 'salesPrice': 0.0, 'salesPriceLabel': '\u20ac 0,00', 'stepValue': 0.0, 'subcategoryIds': [], 'synced': False, 'tags': [], 'texts': [], 'threeDModelItems': [], 'type': 0, 'unitOfMeasure': None, 'unitOfMeasurement': None, 'unitOfMeasurementId': None, 'updatedDate': '2018-10-10T12:09:21.8682548+00:00', 'vat': None, 'vatId': None} In the same way, it is possible to request all the categories from the API, and display them by id and name. Do note that the name is a multilingual field, therefore it returns a list with the names in each language.

It is also required to include the texts, because this is a different object. list(map(lambda c: {c['texts'][0]['value']: c['id']}, db.all('categories').include('texts'))) [{'Model': '4fde3e79-c90e-4844-3d1b-08d50589c407'}, {'Engine': 'c6619774-d2aa-4bc4-3d1d-08d50589c407'}, {'Transmission': 'b60ee5fb-bb67-4420-3d1e-08d50589c407'}, {'Exterior color': '3ef76c1c-0d4a-4598-3d1f-08d50589c407'}, {'Chassis': '79d10665-18ca-4405-3d20-08d50589c407'}, {'Interior': '88e43ee0-be1c-4efe-3d21-08d50589c407'}, {'Infotainment': 'dd2c73a1-007d-4c32-3d22-08d50589c407'}, {'Rims': 'a51f921f-8ba4-47b1-3d23-08d50589c407'}, {'Tires': '1c52e16f-fb87-41dd-3d24-08d50589c407'}, {'Exhaust': '2ad69069-8e98-4034-d91b-08d507486180'}, {'Sedans': '2ac6bffb-2543-48f3-f3d4-08d5688fd09d'}, {'Off-road': 'e4e18ddb-9cc2-4155-67c6-08d568a38d77'}]","title":"Getting started"}]}
